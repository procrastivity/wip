# /wip:intake — round-trip an inbound plan file into the canonical kind

Drives the intake pipeline ([ADR-0009](../engineering/decisions/0009-intake-as-pipeline.md))
end-to-end, with **Claude as the shaper** (no `wip ask` / provider call — you
are the LLM). The state machine is the same as the CLI porcelain's
`wip intake`; the only differences are:

- **Shape step** = you read the inbound file + the shaper prompts and
  rewrite it yourself, not a provider call.
- **Clarifying questions** = you ask the user inline in this chat. The
  CLI's `---ASK---` fence protocol exists for non-interactive
  request/response loops; you do NOT emit `---ASK---` blocks. Just ask
  the user one short question in chat and wait for the answer.

The command body's instructions WIN for the duration of this flow — if
the user's prior chat context conflicts, the pipeline contract here is
authoritative until `apply` returns or the flow errors out.

## Procedure

1. **Resolve plumbing.** Run `command -v wip-plumbing`. If absent and
   `$WIP_PLUMBING_BIN` is unset, print a one-line install hint and stop:
   > `wip-plumbing` is not on PATH. Install wip first (see the project README) or set $WIP_PLUMBING_BIN.

2. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`.** Extract the positional `<file>` plus optional
   `--kind <k>`, `--target <t>`, and `--anchor <ID>`. `<file>` is required;
   if missing, stop and ask the user which file to shape. `--anchor <ID>` is
   the durable initiative→source-issue link (ADR-0024); it applies to a
   `brief` only and forwards to `intake apply --anchor` in step 9.

3. **Classify (plumbing).** Run `wip-plumbing intake classify <file>`.
   On exit ≠ 0, surface the error envelope verbatim and stop.

4. **Pick the kind.**
   - If the user passed `--kind <k>`, use it (skip the confidence check).
   - Else if classify returned `"confidence": "high"`, use that kind
     silently.
   - Else surface classify's guess + signals to the user in one line and
     ask: "Use kind `<guess>`, or override (brief/amendment/workplan-seed/spec/handoff/bundle)?"
   - A roadmap-shaped lead doc (parallel tracks + a foundational prereq + a
     recommended sequence, no `target:`) classifies as `bundle` at low
     confidence — confirm before exploding.

5. **Fetch shaper prompts.** Run, in order:
   - `wip-plumbing template show intake/preamble`
   - `wip-plumbing template show intake/<kind>`

   Concatenate (preamble + blank line + per-kind rules) — that's the
   shape contract you must follow. Do NOT skip this step or paraphrase
   the rules from memory; read them fresh each invocation. The byte
   bundle is shared with the CLI porcelain so behavior stays consistent
   across both frontends.

6. **Shape.** Read the inbound file (Read tool). Rewrite it into a
   tempfile per the shape rules. Use `mktemp -t wip-intake.XXXXXX.md`
   for the path (then Write to it). For a `brief`, also fill the optional
   `tracker-anchor: <ID>` front-matter key (ADR-0024) — the durable
   source-issue anchor: take it from an explicit `--anchor <ID>`, else the
   source issue the plan came from (e.g. a Linear id named in the artifact),
   else ASK the user once ("Which issue anchors this initiative? (or none)")
   and omit the key if they say none. For a **bundle** the anchor is the
   lead/epic issue if one exists, else the primary source issue (per-child
   issues ride their own step/round `[tracker:]` keys). If a required field
   is missing and you cannot confidently infer it from the artifact:
   - Ask the user ONE short clarifying question inline in this chat.
   - Wait for the answer.
   - Incorporate the answer and re-shape.
   Never invent facts; if you cannot ask (e.g. user said "do your best")
   add a `## TODO (shaper guesses)` list to the bottom of the shaped
   artifact naming each guess.

7. **Validate (plumbing).** Run
   `wip-plumbing intake validate --kind <k> <tempfile>`. On `missing[]`,
   patch the tempfile to address the gap and re-validate. Cap at **2**
   reshape attempts (CLI parity). After 2 failed validates, stop and
   report the validation envelope to the user.

8. **Route.** Derive the apply `--target` (CLI parity):
   - User-supplied `--target` wins.
   - For `brief`: derive slug from shaped front-matter `slug:` or the
     H1; confirm with the user in chat ("New initiative `<slug>` — go
     ahead?") before applying. Carry the anchor through: a `--anchor <ID>`
     on the command line wins; otherwise `apply` reads the shaped
     `tracker-anchor:` front-matter key (step 6). Pass `--anchor <ID>` to
     the apply call in step 9 when it came from the command line.
   - For `amendment`: read `target:` + the directive
     (`insert-after`/`replace`/`append-round`) from the shaped
     front-matter. Validate has already enforced their presence; no
     further question.
   - For `workplan-seed`: read `target: <slug>/<step-id>` from the
     shaped front-matter.
   - For `spec`/`handoff`: pass through (apply will exit 3/4
     respectively; do not try to coerce).
   - For `bundle`: do NOT route or apply here — bundle is non-terminal
     (`apply --kind bundle` exits 4). Go to step 8b instead.

8b. **Explode (bundle only).** A bundle's shaped artifact is a LEAD doc plus
   a `children:` manifest. Recurse — invoke THIS pipeline (steps 5-10) once
   for the lead and once per child:
   - **Lead.** Materialize a lead artifact = the bundle body with the
     bundle-only front-matter keys (`wip-kind`, `lead-as`, `children`,
     `cross-cuts`) stripped, then (for `lead-as: amendment`) append one
     empty `### Lane <name>` per distinct `children[].lane` and a
     `## Cross-cuts (from bundle)` section from `cross-cuts.shared-seams`.
     Apply it as its `lead-as` kind (`amendment` → `roadmap amend`,
     `brief` → `init`). Note the round number `N` from the lead's
     `## Round N` heading.
   - **Children.** Topo-sort by `depends-on`. For each child, seed an
     amendment whose directive is `insert-step-in-lane: <lane>` +
     `target-round: N` (lane-fillers) or the child's explicit directive
     hint, prepend it to the child doc's body, then run steps 5-10 on that
     seed with the forced `--kind`. A child with neither a `lane` nor a
     directive is already folded into the lead body — skip it. Never let a
     child be `bundle` (nested bundles are refused).
   - **Aggregate.** Report one envelope: `{ok, kind: "bundle", target,
     lead: {...}, children: [...], summary}`. `ok` is true iff the lead and
     every applied child succeeded. Per-child apply is independent
     (non-atomic): a failed child is reported, not rolled back; re-running
     is safe via the amendment hash markers.

9. **Apply (plumbing).** Run
   `wip-plumbing intake apply --kind <k> [--target <t>] [--anchor <ID>] <tempfile>`.
   Echo the resulting write ledger (the JSON output) in a code block,
   plus a one-line prose summary like "amended distillation/roadmap.md:
   insert-after step-06". On exit-4 from apply, report the envelope
   verbatim.

10. **Point at what's next (don't guess).** After a successful apply, ask
    the plumbing what comes next instead of improvising — run
    `wip-plumbing next --initiative <slug>` (for a `brief`, `<slug>` is the new
    initiative; for `amendment`/`workplan-seed`, the target slug) and render
    its **top candidate verbatim**. Do NOT substitute your own suggestion
    (in particular, do NOT tell the user to run `/wip:start` unless the top
    candidate is a concrete `step-NN`). Two cases to spell out:
    - **`source: "scaffold"`** (title `author the roadmap`) — the initiative
      exists but its roadmap is still the empty skeleton with no steps. Say
      so, name the file from the candidate's `path`, and end with exactly:

      Next: author the roadmap at `<path>` against the new `BRIEF.md` — turn
      it into Rounds and Steps. Do it by hand, or say `go` and I'll draft
      Round 1 from the brief for you.

      On `go`, read the `BRIEF.md`, propose Rounds/Steps for review, and once
      approved write them in (hand-edit `roadmap.md`, or shape an `amendment`
      with `append-round` and apply via `roadmap amend`). Then re-run
      `wip-plumbing next` so a real `step-NN` is the new top candidate.

      When proposing steps, **assess parallelism before settling the order**:
      identify which proposed steps are mutually independent — they touch
      disjoint files/surfaces and have no ordering between them — and where two
      or more are, propose an ADR-0010 lane shape rather than a forced sequence.
      A laned round is `main* (lane+) main*`: an optional shared prereq in the
      main lane, then one `### Lane <name>` per independent track (steps within a
      lane sequential, lanes parallel across), then optional post-lane main-lane
      sync steps. Only lane work that is genuinely non-conflicting — no two lanes
      editing the same file; when in doubt, keep it sequential and say why.
      Surface the lane proposal in the same review so the human can confirm or
      flatten it — don't silently linearize independent tracks.

      When `issue-tracker` is enabled, you can also **address tracker nodes** as
      you author (ADR-0024). A step bullet or a `## Round N — title` heading may
      carry a trailing `[tracker: BDS-XX]` marker; `wip sync` then surfaces and
      pushes that node's lifecycle forward alongside the steps. Do **not** put a
      `[tracker:]` key on a `### Lane` heading — a lane is a grouping, not a
      lifecycle node (ADR-0010), so the parser ignores a lane tracker key. The
      **initiative-level** anchor is NOT authored in the roadmap: it is captured
      at intake (`--anchor <ID>` or the `tracker-anchor:` brief front-matter,
      step 6) and persisted to `.wip.yaml` as the `initiative` node — leave it
      out of the roadmap entirely.
    - **concrete `step-NN`** — render it and note that `/wip:start <id>`
      activates it.

11. **Cleanup.** Remove the tempfile (`rm -- <tempfile>`) on success. For a
    bundle, remove the lead + per-child seed tempfiles too.

## Notes

- The shape rules come from `templates/prompts/intake/*.md`; the CLI
  porcelain and this command read the SAME files via `wip-plumbing
  template show`. If you ever feel tempted to edit shape rules
  inline here, edit the source files instead.
- `--dry-run` is not exposed at this layer; the user can run `wip intake
  --dry-run <file>` against the CLI porcelain for that.
- This command body is the contract; do not improvise off-script.
