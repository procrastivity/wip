// Package assets embeds the shipped default asset tree as the last-resort
// fallback the chassis asset-resolution chain reaches for when neither a
// user override ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wip/) nor an installed share tree
// (<prefix>/share/wip/assets/) has the requested file — e.g. a bare `go run`
// with nothing installed. Assets are inputs, never state (D36): this package
// only ever reads the tree baked in at build time.
